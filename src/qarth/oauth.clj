  Create an auth service from a hash map specification.

  Mandatory fields:
  :type -- the type of the service; multimethods dispatch on this

  Usually required for OAuth:
  :api-key -- your API key. the [type, api-key] pair uniquely identifies a service
  :api-secret -- your API secret

  Implementations may accept other fields also, such as the following:
  :callback -- a callback URL for interactive browser logins

  Auth services contain secret information, like api secret keys.
  Be careful if about writing or serializing them."

(defmulti requestor
  "Multimethod. Usage:
  (let [r (requestor service record)]

  Returns a fn that can be used to make requests to the auth service.
  The requestor works similarly to the Clojure library clj-http.
  If the record is inactive (perhaps it expired or was never activated),
  throws a Slingshot exception {::qarth.core/unauthorized true}.

  Mandatory opt:
  :url -- the request URL

  Supported opts:
  :method -- :GET, :PUT, :POST, :DELETE, default :GET
  :body -- the HTTP body for PUT or POST. Overrides form-params.
  Can be anything usable by clojure.java.io (e.g. a String or byte array).
  :form-params -- the form parameters
  :query-params -- the query parameters
  :headers -- a string->string map
  :follow-redirects -- true or false, default true
  :as -- coerce to something else, must support at least :stream

  Returns a Ring-Style response map containing at least:
  :status -- the status code
  :headers -- the http headers
  :body -- a string or InputStream or something else
  (if it's an InputStream, be sure to close it when you're done!)

  If an exceptional status code happens, throws an Exception instead.
  Other implementations might support more opts and return more stuff.

  A default implementation is provided for implementors. It adds the param
  :access_token to the form params if it's a POST, and the query if it's a GET."
