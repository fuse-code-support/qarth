  failure-handler -- Called when an auth record exists, is inactive,

  first.

  new-record-handler -- Called when this handler detects no auth record.
  Default is qarth.ring/new-record-redirect-handler.
  exception-handler -- a function (f request exception). The default
  is to log the exception, remove the auth record, and call failure-handler.
  fallback -- If true, verification attempts that fail will be assumed
  to be initial auth attempts, and will call new-record-handler instead.
